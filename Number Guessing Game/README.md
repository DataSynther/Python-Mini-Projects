# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python console game where you try to guess a randomly selected number between 0 and 9.

## How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number between 0 and 9.
- You are prompted to guess the number.
- If your guess is too low or too high, the program will tell you and let you guess again.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number.
- If you enter invalid input, the program will display an error message.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```
    python number_guess.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your guesses.

## Example
